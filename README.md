## üå± Currently
Actively looking for full-time roles in Informatics or Data Analytics while refreshing/enhancing my technical skillset through [Reskill Americans](https://www.reskillamericans.org/). 
Curious about software engineering and the intersection of healthcare + tech. 

## üí¨ Background
- (2018) Graduated from Northeastern University with a B.S Biochemistry with the intention of going to medical school. Took an "Intro to Python" and became more curious. 
- (2018) Decided to pivot from the med school route. Accepted into Northeastern's [M.S. Bioinformatics](https://cos.northeastern.edu/bioinformatics/) program. Wanted to combine tech + Biology. 
- (2020) Completed an 8 month internship at Merck & Co. The job hunt begins. 
- (2021) The job hunt continues. Participated in my first hackathon, Pearl Hacks 2021! Joined Reskill American's first cohort!
